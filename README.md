This project mainly uses SQL and R for analysis, focuses on analyzing beachwear sales performance and identifying key factors influencing conversion rates.


## üìù Objectives  
We aimed to answer the research question:  

> **What independent variables affect the conversion rate in the beachwear category at Wehkamp?**  

Key analysis areas:  
- **WHO**: Demographics  
- **WHAT**: Product and Behavior  
- **WHEN**: Time  
- **WHERE**: Geography

## üìä Data Sources  
1. **Internal Wehkamp Data**:  
   - Clickstream, customer sessions, product views, and order details.  
2. **External Data**:  
   - Weather Data (KNMI)  
   - COVID-19 Cases (Johns Hopkins CSSE)  
   - Google Trends Data (Wehkamp search interest).

## üîç Key Analyses  
1. **Data Integration**:  
   - Merged internal Wehkamp data with external weather, COVID-19, and Google Trends data.  
2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Imputed missing values using MICE.  
   - Outlier detection and removal using Mahalanobis Distance.  
3. **Statistical Analysis**:  
   - Chi-square tests for categorical variables.  
   - Logistic and Linear regression models to identify significant factors.  
4. **Visualization**:  
   - Created charts, scatter plots, and trends to communicate findings.

## üöÄ Project Highlights  
- Analyzed **500,000+ records** to derive actionable insights.  
- Identified key drivers of sales conversions:  
   - **Weather (mean temperature)** correlates positively with sales.  
   - **Income, age, and education** significantly impact conversion rates.  
   - **Excessive product views** negatively correlate with conversions.  
- Built predictive models to identify and explain significant features.
